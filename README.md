# Data Science and Artificial Intelligence - Project and Task 6

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of data science and machine learning. Both notebooks leverage Keras, a powerful deep learning framework, along with various machine learning techniques, including the use of Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization, to build, optimize, and evaluate models.

### 1. **notebooks/Project6.ipynb**

This notebook is part of a larger project aimed at building and evaluating machine learning models. The key sections include:

- **Importing Necessary Libraries:**
  - It imports essential libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and others required for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
  - Keras is used extensively for deep learning tasks, including model building, training, and evaluation.

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
  - The notebook loads the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Preprocessing steps include normalizing pixel values and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

- **Baseline Model with Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms:**
  - Implements baseline models using traditional machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, along with deep learning models built with Keras.
  - Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE are used to visualize the data.
  - Ensemble learning is introduced through a Voting Classifier to combine multiple models, including those built with Keras.

- **Model Training, Tuning, and Evaluation:**
  - Models, including Keras-based deep learning models, are trained on the preprocessed data.
  - Keras Tuner is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models, ensuring the best possible performance.
  - The notebook evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
  - Techniques such as early stopping and model checkpoints in Keras are employed to prevent overfitting during training.

### 2. **notebooks/Task6.ipynb**

This notebook delves into more advanced techniques, focusing on feature engineering, handling imbalanced data, and optimizing models with Keras and Keras Tuner. The key sections include:

- **Task Introduction:**
  - The notebook begins by specifying references and documentation for key techniques used, including Random Oversampling (SMOTE), MinMaxScaler, and Keras Tuner.

- **Initial Imports and Setup:**
  - It imports necessary libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), machine learning (`LogisticRegression`, `SMOTE`), and visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
  - Keras is heavily used for building and optimizing neural networks, with the environment set up to ensure reproducibility.

- **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  - The notebook loads a predictive maintenance dataset.
  - It performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, including the distribution of different types and failure modes.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - This section focuses on creating and transforming features to enhance model performance. Techniques like scaling (`MinMaxScaler`, `StandardScaler`) and encoding (`OrdinalEncoder`, `LabelEncoder`) are used.

- **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
  - The notebook addresses class imbalance using techniques like Borderline SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), crucial for improving model accuracy in imbalanced datasets.

- **Model Training, Tuning, and Optimization with Keras:**
  - The notebook trains machine learning models and uses Keras Tuner to perform hyperparameter tuning, optimizing both traditional models and Keras-based neural networks for better performance.
  - The importance of hyperparameter tuning is emphasized to ensure the best possible model configuration.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - The performance of the models, including Keras-based models, is evaluated using metrics such as F1-score. The results are compared to assess the effectiveness of the different techniques applied.
